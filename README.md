the small headers are not centered, there seems to be some padding-left and margin-left that I don't think I want.  

The hero image dissapears to the left in mobile size, I want it to centre. 

The sign up button seems off center and goes green when it's being clicked (fine before and after, and on hover, just when clicking)!

Am I Responsive?
